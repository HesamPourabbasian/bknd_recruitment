# Robot Simulation

A Python project that simulates the behavior of different types of robots, including flying, wheeled, and hybrid robots. The simulation models robot movements, energy consumption, and mode-switching for hybrid robots, using object-oriented programming concepts like inheritance, abstract classes, and mixins.

## Features
- **Robot Types**: Implements `FlyingRobot`, `WheeledRobot`, and `HybridRobot` with unique movement behaviors.
- **Energy Management**: Tracks energy levels and enforces energy costs for powering on and moving.
- **Dynamic Simulation**: Randomly generates robots and simulates their actions with configurable parameters.
- **Extensible Design**: Built with abstract base classes and mixins for easy addition of new robot types.
