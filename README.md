This repository contains all of my Python projects that Iâ€™ve worked on while learning the language. Most of these projects were done as assignments or practice exercises given by my teacher.

The purpose of this repo is to keep track of my progress and to have a collection of everything Iâ€™ve built so far during my Python learning journey.
